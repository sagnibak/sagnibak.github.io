My name is Sagnik (साग्निक/সাগ্নিক) Bhattacharya, but I often spell it _Sagnick_.
You can use the pronouns he/him/his when you talk about me in English.
That picture up there really is a picture of me, but from 2012. A more recent
photo of me is on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sagnik-bhattacharya-83121b114/).

Currently I am pursuing an MS in CS at the University of California,
Berkeley, doing deep learning theory research with
[Professor Jonathan Shewchuk](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~jrs/).
<!-- I am a [Siebel Scholar](https://www.siebelscholars.com/) in Computer Science. -->
I double-majored in Computer Science and Statistics at
UC Berkeley during my undergrad. I was part of the
[CS Honors Program](https://eecs.berkeley.edu/resources/undergrads/honors).
I received the [Dean's Honor](https://lsadvising.berkeley.edu/policies/deans-listhonors)
in Fall 2018, Spring 2019, and Fall 2019. I am a member of
[Upsilon Pi Epsilon](https://upe.berkeley.edu/), the CS Honor Society at Cal.

<!-- In Spring 2020, I was a TA for 
[CS 189](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~jrs/189/) (Introduction to Machine
Learning) and a Senior [Computer Science Mentor](https://csmentors.berkeley.edu/#/)
for [CS 70](http://www.eecs70.org/) (Discrete Math and Probability Theory). -->

[This](https://github.com/sagnibak/teaching) GitHub repository
contains notes from my discussion sections.

In Spring 2021 and Spring 2020 I was a TA for
[CS 189](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~jrs/189/) (Introduction to Machine
Learning).
<!-- In Spring 2020 I was also a TA for this course. -->
I designed, wrote, and coded a neural network package along with
[Sophia Sanborn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sophia-sanborn-214bbb161/)
in addition to teaching a discussion section and holding office hours every
week.

This semester I am a TA for [CS 70](https://www.eecs70.org/) (Discrete Math and Probability Theory).
In Summer 2020 I was Head TA for the same course, and in Fall 2020 I
was a TA for it. As Head TA,
I managed assignments, oversaw grading, and planned the general flow of the course.
As both TA and Head TA, my responsibilities included
teaching two to four 1-hour discussion sections each week, and holding office hours.

I went to TreeHacks in February 2020 and built [this](https://ml-visualizer.herokuapp.com/)
web app which visualizes the decision boundaries of different machine learning models on
different datasets. This project won the Best Data Visualization Hack award.

I am fluent in English, Hindi, Bangla, French, Python, Scheme, SQL, C, Rust, Java, and BrainF**k.
And I have a decent level of proficiency in Spanish, Urdu, Sanskrit,
Esperanto, C++, and Javascript.
I swim, bike, run, and lift weights in my free time. [Here's](https://www.strava.com/athletes/15525501)
my Strava. I also like to DM for Dungeons and Dragons.
